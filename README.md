# love-pe

LOVE-PE is a WIP program for hacking some resources inside exe files (and possibly .dll files) using love and lua only, with no native lua libraries dependencies (So it can run on Windows, Linux, Mac, Android and even iOS) !

The current goal of the project is to make it possible to replace the icon.

## Current Achievements:
- Parses the DataDirectory and the Sections Table of a PE (exe/dll) file.
- Parses the resources directory and extracts it.
-
